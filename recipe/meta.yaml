#  To create a single env using OpenCE packages we require boost-cpp to be installed alongside boost_mp11.
#  Hence disabling this restriction.
#  run_constrained:
#    # Cannot be installed at the same time as boost-cpp as it clobbers the mp11 headers
#    - boost-cpp <0a0

test:
  commands:
    - test -f $PREFIX/include/boost/mp11.hpp  # [linux]
